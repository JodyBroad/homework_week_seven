# 1 - create a new customer record when they make first purchase
# 2 - update customer record when they make a subsequent purchase
# 3 - create new employee record when they start
# 4 - update employee record (pay rise, job change etc.)
# should this be two different interfaces? a customer based one and an employee based one?
